Hi! this is the first version of the git! There are 3 simple python apps in here:
- **grade_mhs.py** is a simple grade classification to determine student grades based on the value.
- **graduates.py** is another simple script to determine the student's graduation based on the score and absence
- **livecode.py** is a task manager app to add, modify, view tasks. The task's attributes are name, priority, and status
